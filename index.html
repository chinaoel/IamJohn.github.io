            <h3>Machine Learning Internship</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              Providing a loan to customer has always been a crucial task for banks.</p>
            <br>
              <p>
              My main job was to train a machine learning classification model
              that can classify those who have potential to request a loan from
              the bank. 
            </p>
            <br>
              <p>
                Thus, the loan business can grow with precise targeting.
                Also, I introduced a data scraping framework into company for them
                to scrape external data more efficiently.

            <h3>Data Engineering Internship</h3>
            <br>
            <p>There are numerous crypto exchanges out there trading 24/365. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Difference in trading behaviors from those exchanges might deviate the price thus provide chances to buy low and sell high.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I seeked to design a program that can exploit the price difference between exchange pairs simultaneously using Python.</p>

            <p>There's no denying the power of big data is the fuel of cutting edge model and technology </p>
            <br>
            <p>My duty was to use Python to scrape data from large news source from the internet, do some data cleaning, store them into RDB</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also got to experience some other tools such as git, RabbitMQ, puppeteer.</p>

                <p>In this project, we implemented a web application specifically for employee who spare no time to find a parking space.

                <br>
                <p>
                    With our application, the user is able to reserve a parking space within two click. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The application also features cancelling reservation, checking previous records, checking parking space status, allowing admin to monitor the usage of parking lot.</p>

                <br>
                    <p>Therefore, we collected dataset from kaggle, combining with data from spotify API. The dataset spans from 1980 to 2023</p>
                <br>
                    <p>The project consider three types of features, songs' metadata, lyrics mood, and audio feature</p>
                <br>
                    <p>We found the primary factor that affect the popularity of a song is its artist, and song duration.</p>
